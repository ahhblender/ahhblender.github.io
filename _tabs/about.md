Welcome to my blog about tech art, game dev, Blender, and Python! My name is Greg Hendrix and I'm a Lead Character Technical Artist with 12+ years experience in the game industry.

As someone relatively new to using Blender, this blog is about my journey as I delve into Blender's Python API. Along the way I'll be documenting my discoveries and learnings as I go while adopting the concept of learning in public.

#### Why learning in public?

Learning in public means embracing the process of trial and error openly, without fear of making mistakes or taking wrong turns. Every step of the learning journey is valuable, regardless of whether it leads to success or not. I hope by sharing my experience you too can learn from my successes and mistakes.
